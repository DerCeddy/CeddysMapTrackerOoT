# Manual
## Map Tracker Colors
Green = You can do the check

Yellow = You can theoretically do the check but you need to get one item that is not randomized/randomized in a specific area. For example beans or keys

Red = You can't do the check

Blue = You can do these checks with bombchus but they are not in logic (some dungeons are missing)

Light Blue = You can peek this check (only like 3 checks at the moment. The rest is WIP)
## Map Tracker Controls
Left Click = Select

Middle Click = Check/Uncheck everything inside a region

Right Click = Open Context Wheel for the Path Hints Panel

## Path Hints
To add a Path Hint simply right click on the area and select the desired goal.

If you accidentally selected the wrong region, you can left click the text box to delete the text inside.

## Gossip Stones
This works the same as in the Gossip Stone Tracker. Simply hold left click on an item and drag it onto a gossip stone
## Settings
Clicking the gear symbol in the bottom left corner opens the settings panel. Here you can select presets, change the amount of hints, change the the style of the icons (N64 or 3Ds), etc..
## Presets
With presets you can load starting items, hint counts, enabled/disabled checks and customize sometimes hints. Presets are contained in the "Preset" folder in the json format. I try to update them regulary if a new tournament begins
## Misc
Overworld check names are renameable in the "checknames.json" file
